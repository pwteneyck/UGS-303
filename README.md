=======
This repository contains code to generate a four dimensional Mandelbrot set.  The process and logic is explained in this Google 
doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/11QsBDZ-kN4WtWdfG6n-8nifseUatW78RhdWIeqkkmEs/

The Python code uses Matplotlib to render frames for videos.  Matplotlib requires numpy and a bunch of other things, all 
mentioned in its documentation (see paper for links).
